# Fizzbuzz via TDD

Worked on Fizzbuzz with Ricky to introduce ourselves to TDD & pair programming.

## Getting started

`git clone https://github.com/defc0nONE/fizzbuzz.git`

## Usage

When in the root directory of the program, run `irb` through the terminal and enter `require ./lib/fizzbuzz`

## Running tests

RSpec is required to run the tests. If it's not installed, use the command `gem install rspec` to install it.
When in the root directory of the program, run `rspec` through the terminal.
